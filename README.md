If the password is weak, the tool tells you what is missing and how to make it stronger.

This tool helps users understand how to create strong passwords that are difficult to guess or break.

How It Works (Simple Explanation)

The tool checks the password using five important rules:

✔ 1. Length Check

The password should be at least 8 characters long.
Short passwords are easier to crack using brute-force attacks.

✔ 2. Uppercase Letter Check

It checks if the password contains at least one uppercase (A–Z).
Uppercase letters make the password more complex.

✔ 3. Lowercase Letter Check

It checks for at least one lowercase letter (a–z).
Mixing uppercase + lowercase makes the password stronger.

✔ 4. Number Check

The tool checks if the password includes at least one number (0–9).
Numbers help increase password unpredictability.

✔ 5. Special Character Check

It checks for characters like
! @ # $ % ^ & * ( ) ? > < { }
Special characters make passwords much harder to guess.
